% IMPORTANT: Try using a array based approach for tensor BMM instead of
% an unordered map. The array should be sorted and then contracted based
% on the indices. The unordered map is slow for large quantities of data
% because of the hasing that has to take place.

Compared to Einsum with dense tensors, Einsum with sparse tensors has received
little attention in the scientific community. Due to the fact that Einsum can
be used to compute various expressions the underlying algorithms need to handle
many different computations. Here we introduce multiple approaches and ideas,
contributing to the field of sparse Einsum.\\
The incorporation of linear algebra routines into SQL has received more attention
recently. (CITE HERE)
An approach mapping Einsum problems to SQL queries showed a good performance 
 
Suprisingly, one of the simplest algorithms to compute sparse Einsum problems
can be 

- many operations not well researched and fine-tuned
- recently SQL has gained in popularity in linear algebra operations
-
